# 🛒 Stuff for Sale – Node.js REST API + React Frontend

This is a full-stack project where I built a **RESTful API server** from scratch using **Node.js without frameworks**, and connected it to a **React-based frontend** that dynamically interacts with the backend.

> 🔧 This project helped me deeply understand how Express.js works under the hood by handling all HTTP methods, routing, and file I/O manually—without using any backend frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ GET, PUT, POST, DELETE API support
- ✅ JSON file-based data persistence (no external database)
- ✅ Full-stack routing logic (manual parsing with `url` and `fs`)
- ✅ React frontend built with functional components and hooks
- ✅ Real-time updates for items (add, edit, delete)
- ✅ Clean UI styled with Bootstrap
- ✅ Fully deployable as a single full-stack app

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js (native `http`, `url`, `fs` modules)
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap (compiled into static files)
- **Persistence**: JSON file (`items.json`)

---

## 📦 Deployment

This project is deployed as a **single full-stack application** (React build + Node.js server). React's static files are served by the backend, allowing seamless routing and interaction.
